You can choose profession and character with the option menus. To display all the list, you have to click on the arrows at the top and the bottom of the choices.

### Ranges
You can let the boxes empty. If you fill them, put the MIN value and the MAX value like this : `MIN.MAX`. If MIN=MAX, you can just put `MIN` or `MAX`.

## Generate a person
When you completed the form, you can click on "OK" (maybe that the button is "submit this form".)

A new tab opened with the person generated.

NOTE: The first names and the names are all from a FRENCH database, so they sound French. Sorry :/

You can save the person if you want. Just click on the 'save' button, then save wherever you want.

To open your files, go to `File>Open` or hit `Ctrl+O` (even under MacOS)
